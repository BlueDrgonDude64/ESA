This example illustrates the procedure to perform transient stability(TS) analysis
and obtain the TS result. To retrieve the result, the most convenient way is to create
a plot object and connect the object/fields pairs to it, then you will be able to query it
using the :code:`TSGetCongencyResults` function.

.. code:: python

    CASE_PATH = r"C:\Users\myuser\git\ESA\tests\cases\il200\ACTIVSg200.pwb"

Load the case first and then solve a PF (optional):

.. code:: python

    >>> from esa import SAW
    >>> saw = SAW(CASE_PATH)
    >>> saw.SolvePowerFlow()

Then perform TS analysis (make sure you already have a desired plot object)

.. code:: python

    >>> t1 = 0.0
    >>> t2 = 15.0
    >>> stepsize = 0.01

        # Solve.
    >>> cmd = 'TSSolve("{}",[{},{},{},NO])'.format(
            self.ctg_name, t1, t2, stepsize
        )
    >>> saw.RunScriptCommand(cmd)

Once it is done, you could retrieve (and visualize) the results:

.. code:: python

    >>> objFieldList = ['Plot ''Area_Avg Bus Hz''']  # "Area_Avg Bus Hz" is the plot name
    >>> result = sa.TSGetContingencyResults("My Transient Contingency", objFieldList, 0, 12)  # "My Transient Contingency" is the contingency name
    >>> df = result[1]  #result[0] is meta data
    >>> df.columns = ['Time (s)', 'Area_Avg Bus Hz']
    >>> df.plot(x='Time (s)', y='Area_Avg Bus Hz')

The whole process, including setting up plots and creating contingencies, could be fully
automated, but it might be easier for most users to pre-define the plots and contingencies
in the case and then load the case using ESA. GetParametersMultipleElement cannot be used
here to retrieve the TS datapoints (which is a very rare situation).

*10/26/2022 Update* You could access and modify the TS-related objects and fields using ESA.
In other words, no need to create and use the aux file for those tasks. If you encounter errors
when accessing some of the objects, setting `pw_order` (a SAW property) to true might solve the issue.
